# Modular Evolutionary Robotics
This repository contains an implementation of a modular evolutionary robotics
experiment. The aim is to evolve modular robots which are tasked with
locomotion. The experiment will compare different evolutionary algorithms,
single-objective EA, multi-objective EA (NSGAII) and MAP-Elites in order to
better understand evolvability in these systems.

From a biological perspective evolvability is the ability to evolve a diverse
set of solutions with the same fitness objective. In contrast to other usage of
the term evolvability, in biology this cannot be measure within the population,
but can be measured between populations. The system which evolves the more fit
solutions are by definition more evolvable because they were able to solve the
problem better. This does not preclude the possibility of such an evolvable
system converging.
